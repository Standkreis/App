# .vscode

This folder contains a `settings.json.example` file which forces .vscode to automatically format your code whenever you safe a file. This is not mandatory but helps you to keep the code style consistent across without ever thinking about it.

All you need to do is to remove `.example` and install these VSCode extensions:

- **[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)**
- **[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)**
